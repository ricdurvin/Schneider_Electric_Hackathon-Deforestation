# Schneider Electric Hackathon - Zero Deforestation Mission

This repository contains the code for the Schneider Electric European Hackathon. 

Deforestation is the permanent removal of standing forests, which occurs for a variety of reasons and has many devastating consequences. It is important to stop deforestation, as soon as possible, before the damage is irreversible.

This challenge will consist of using the help of thousands of satellites in space to capture images of the earth's surface in order to detect, as soon as possible, areas in the midst of deforestation and prevent its expansion.

The following is a brief description of each of the data files.
